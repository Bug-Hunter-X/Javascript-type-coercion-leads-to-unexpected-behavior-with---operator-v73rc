This repository contains a simple example of a common Javascript bug caused by type coercion. The bug occurs when using the + operator with a mixture of numbers and strings. Javascript will perform string concatenation instead of numerical addition if one of the operands is a string. This can lead to unexpected results and difficult to debug errors. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this issue using explicit type checking or conversion before performing the addition.
